# Git Message Check Maven Plugin

A maven plugin that checks given commit messages

In our company, for our maven projects, we use js solutions for commit message convention checking, so i wanted to write a maven plugin to do it. My aim is that this plugin should do pretty much same job as the current status, without the extra unnecessary checks or configurations.

#### current maven plugin example(that i'm using for dev & testing):

```xml

<plugin>
    <groupId>io.github.kambaa</groupId>
    <artifactId>gmc-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <configuration>

        <!--
            <multipleGitLogMessages>
             
                Enter your historical git log messages here 
                with splitting value, default is:
                ------------------------ >8 ------------------------
                or customize you can customize it.
                
            </multipleGitLogMessages>

            <multipleGitLogMessageSplitter>
                (OPTIONAL) Enter your custom splitting text for the plugin to understand. 
                Again default value is:
                ------------------------ >8 ------------------------
            </multipleGitLogMessageSplitter>
        -->

        <!-- Test or validate a single message -->
        <testCommitMessage>
            feat: some message that is way too long and breaks the line max-length

            awdawdawdawdawdawd aw da aw aw dawd awd aw

            seni Allah bildiÄŸi gibi yapsÄ±n

            awdawd

            www
        </testCommitMessage>

        <!-- (OPTIONAL): fail maven build on error. Default: true -->
        <failOnError>true</failOnError>
        <!-- (OPTIONAL): skips this plugin's execution. Default: false -->
        <skip>false</skip>
    </configuration>
</plugin>

```

You can get the log messages with `git` command, get the list of commit messages to check, and give it to this plugin like this: 
```shell
mvn io.github.kambaa:gmc-maven-plugin:check -DmultipleGitLogMessages=<COMBINED_LOG_MESSAGES_HERE>
```
or add `<pluginGroup>gmc-maven-plugin</pluginGroup>` to your plugin groups in your `settings.xml`, and call like this: 

```shell
mvn gmc:check -DmultipleGitLogMessages=<COMBINED_LOG_MESSAGES_HERE>
```


## My thoughts on current solution:
Apperantly the js solution:  
- calls the git command with arguments itself through a seperate process([code](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/blob/master/packages/git-raw-commits/index.js#L59)),
- gets the resulting text from it,
- splits and processes(not sure) the commits,
- and does the validations which is abstracted heavily but it's configurative, it can be read through the [docs]( https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional#rules). It covers the variety of checks (which in my opinion and for my needs, it's too many and it's not that needed really ðŸ˜Š ).

I don't need that much complication, i can write my own bash script to get the git log combined, and give it to this plugin to check'em. Simplicity is enough and great for me. A simple check for extending should be enough for other peoples needs. IDK right now, I will think of a solution later if Allah is willing.
